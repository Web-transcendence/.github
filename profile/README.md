## Hello from the big four 👋

## Goal of this Organization
It was made to learn more of Github while making the last project of the common core called "ft_transcendence".
Us (the big four) want to use throughout this project the tools of github such as Actions, Pull Request and Issues. Also discover the project sections with the roadmap, backlog and more.
